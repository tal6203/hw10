1. create an HTML page with 2 text box (input type text) + button
   when clicking the button print:
      i.e. first-text-box is : abcd 
           second-text-box is: efgh
   length of the string in the first text box. i.e 4
   length of the string in the second text box. i.e. 4
   this combination: first-textbox + second-textbox + first-textbox i.e. abcdefghacbd
   merge letters combination: i.e. aebfcgdh 
        (*bonus if second word is shorter then round-robin from the start)
   first-textbox-reverse. i.e. dcba
   second letter from first-textbox + second-textbox. i.e. bf

2. create an HTMl page with text box (input type number) + button
   start an empty list (i.e. const list1 = [])
   when clicking the button:
     if the number inside the text box is positive add it to the right-side of the list 
     if the number inside the text box is negative add it to the left-side of the list 
     if the number inside the text box is zero then empty the list (hint: loop and pop until empty)
   after each button click print the list 
   add another button, when clicking it the program will check how many times the 
      number inside the text box appears in the list 
        for example if the number inside the text box is 3
        and the list looks like this: -5, -3, 2, 3, 2, 3
        then 2 will be printed (because 3 appears two times inside the list)
   *bonus: add a button which sorts the list (hint: use sort())

3. create a selector with colors [i.e. red, blue, green]
   add a button 
   add a text 'HELLO JAVA SCRIPT' (i.e. in paragraph)
   whenever the user clicks the button, draw the text in the selected color
